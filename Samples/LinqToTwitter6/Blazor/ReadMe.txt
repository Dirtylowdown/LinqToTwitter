This is a LinqToTwitter Blazor Server Demo.

Note: This demo stores the Twitter API Consumer Key and Consumer Secret in a client side session cookie, which is not secure, do not use this code in production, your private API key and secret is visible to all clients. If you want to use this in production you should find a more secure manner of storing these private & secret API keys.
